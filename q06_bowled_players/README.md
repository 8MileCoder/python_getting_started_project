# Find the names of all players that got bowled out in the second innings.

IPL has always been harsh on the bowlers, and we saw that becoming true in the first match itself.
The bowlers competed as hard as the batsmen themselves.

But such is the nature of T20, that bowlers rarely get praised for their effors.

So, now it's time to appreciate the efforts made by the bowlers.

## Write the function `bowled_out` that :

* Initializes a variable named as `bowled_players` to an empty list.
* Access the deliveries delivered in the second innings from the data.
* Iterate over deliveries and access the names of players whose mode of dismissal was **bowled out** and update the variable `bowled_players` by appending on it.


### Parameters:

| Parameter | dtype | argument type | default value | description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| data | dict | compulsory |  | data loaded from the yaml file |

### Returns:

| Return | dtype | description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variable bowled_players | list | list of players who got bowled out |


So let's do it.
